### 5.1.1 User Interface

#### Surface:
#### Colours:
* White background with dark blue header with white fonts in the landing page for better contrast and easy visualization. 
* Usage of [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to select my colour scheme.
* Images used will not be too bright colours as I am using a white background.
